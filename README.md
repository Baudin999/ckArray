# CK Array

DO NOT USE THIS IMPLEMENTATION YET. IT IS FAR FROM DONE!!

I like the Observer pattern. It is clear, it is smooth and it shines when combined with JavaScript and CoffeeScript.
This is why I've created this little library which creates an Observable array, an array into which you can pass
an observer and pass handlers.
